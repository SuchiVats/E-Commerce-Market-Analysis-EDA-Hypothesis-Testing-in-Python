### 📝 Problem Statement
This project aims to conduct a thorough **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and perform **Hypothesis Testing** on two comprehensive datasets:
1. **Customer Visits**: Dataset containing information on customers visiting the shopping site for purchases.
2. **Marketing Campaigns**: Dataset containing demographic, purchase, and marketing details about various customers.

## 🚀 Project Workflow

### 1. 🔧 Data Preprocessing
We begin by cleaning the datasets and preparing them for analysis. This step includes:
- Handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Standardizing numerical features.

### 2. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We will dive deep into the data to uncover patterns and trends using the following approaches:

#### **Shopping Dataset**:
- **Univariate Analysis**: Visualize features using histograms and box plots to understand their distributions.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Use heatmaps and pair plots to examine relationships between numerical variables.
- **Class Distribution**: Analyze the distribution of the target variable (`Revenue`).
- **Page Engagement**: Analyze page views, session durations, and exit rates to understand user behavior.
- **Visitor Segmentation**: Group users based on visitor type, operating system, region, and traffic type to study their behaviors.

#### **Campaign Dataset**:
- Perform EDA on customer spending habits and product preferences.
- Segment the customers based on income, marital status, and other demographics.

### 3. 🧪 Hypothesis Testing
We perform hypothesis testing to answer the following questions and many more:

- **Is income dependent on education?** 📚
- **Do higher-income people spend more?** 💸
- **Do couples spend more on wine than singles?** 🍷
- **Are people with lower incomes more attracted to campaigns?** 💡

Based on the results, we validate or reject these hypotheses using statistical tests.

## 💡 Key Insights & Findings
- **User Engagement**: We found that users who visited all three page categories had a higher conversion rate.
- **Income & Spending**: Higher-income individuals tend to spend more across all product categories.
- **Campaigns**: Lower-income individuals were more likely to accept marketing campaigns.
